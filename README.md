## Using the Flink Cookiecutter Template for PyFlink Jobs

This template is designed to help you quickly scaffold a PyFlink project, ensuring you have all the necessary files and structure to get started with your Flink jobs. Below are the steps to use this cookiecutter template:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Cookiecutter Python package installed. If you do not have cookiecutter installed, you can install it using pip:

  ```
  pip install cookiecutter
  ```

### Generating Your PyFlink Project

1. **Generate the Project**: Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `<your-project-name>` with the desired name of your project:

   ```
   cookiecutter gh:yourgithubusername/flink-cookiecutter-template --output-dir <your-project-name>
   ```

   This command will prompt you for various configurations like project name, author name, Flink version, etc. Fill these out according to your project's needs.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**: Once the project is generated, move into your project directory:

   ```
   cd <your-project-name>
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: The template uses Poetry for dependency management. Install the project dependencies by running:

   ```
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Explore Your Project**: Your new PyFlink project will include a basic project structure, including a `src` directory for your Flink jobs, a `tests` directory for unit tests, and configuration files for project dependencies and settings.

5. **Running Your Flink Job**: With your environment set up, you can start developing your Flink jobs. Place your job scripts in the `src` directory. You can run your Flink jobs locally or deploy them to a Flink cluster depending on your setup.

### Next Steps

- Customize the `pyproject.toml` file as needed for your project dependencies.
- Develop your Flink jobs within the `src` directory.
- Add unit tests in the `tests` directory to ensure your jobs run as expected.

By following these steps, you can quickly set up and start developing your PyFlink projects using this cookiecutter template.
